    "## Getting the cost of that extra conversion\n",

The first column corresponds to the kind of product; the second column corresponds to the platform in which certain product is advertised; the third column corresponds to the investment of certain product in certain platform; finally, the fourth column corresponds to the conversions of any given product on a specific platform. Also, each observation corresponds to the investment and conversions of X product on Y platform for Z date.\n",

    "3. The sample starts at 01-01-2021 and lasts until 28-02-2022. For each date there is more than one observation, since there are multiple products advertised in multiple platforms.\n",
    "4. There are 6 types of products and 3 types of platforms.\n",
    "5. By the synthetic nature of this dataset, there are no NA values in this format, but there will be later when the index becomes unique and all product and platforms get their own columns for investment and conversions. That is, there will be dates in which there is no data for certain product and platform.\n",
    "6. Overall, average investment (for all products, across all platforms) is around 862 dollars, while average conversions are around 164. Max investment is around 5578, while max conversions gets to 1549. There is a lot of dispersion among investment and conversions, given by the standard deviation.\n",
    "7. As I will not attempt to establish any realtionship between products/platforms, I will not address any correlation between the different combinations of products and platforms. But, it may be interesting to make an extension of this notebook that creates an useful application based on the possible correlation among these variables."

    "### Modelling\n",
    "The idea is to understand what relationship exists between investment and conversions. With domain knowledge at hand, I suspect that there exists a diminishing returns relationship between these two variables, that is, every conversion will be more expensive than the last. Another way of putting it is that every extra dollar invested yields less conversions than the previous dollar.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a statistical standpoint, what I'll be doing is implementing a simple regression model with a constant. The dependent variable will be the conversions for a specific product in a specific platform; the independent variable will be, as expected, investment. To model the idea of diminishing returns I will be applying the square root to investment. There are other possibilities such as taking the fourth root or logarithms, but I got the best results with square root. One may also try out a sigmoidal transformation, but this approach implies that there is a roof for top conversions, unrelated to the level of investment. With the square root there is no such roof, but it will get very expensive to get that extra conversion at higher levels of investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason for restricting myself to just square root is that it is easy to work with, specially later when I create some tools to gain insights using the results from the models. Since the results make overall sense, the suspected relationship is modelled, and it's easy to work with, then I will be sticking myself only to square root, regardless of other possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "One may find interesting to include variables that account for special business events such as holidays, special offers, etc. The reason behind this is that if there is a special event that leads to more conversions, then the model will be picking a relationship that is not entirely correct (even if this special event only lasts a few days or weeks). It'll bias the results, making the model believe that investment is more profitable than it actually is. One should include dummy variables if we know for a fact that certain product in certain platform had an special event. In this case, since it is synthetic data, I have no such information.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be also interesting to include adstock of investment. The idea behind this is that if I invest a 100 dollars today it will not only have an impact today, but also tomorrow and the after and so on, but to a lesser degree. But the truth is that I tried this approach and it didn't yield any good results, that is, p-values were always quite bad. Therefore, I decided to not include in this notebook. But is worth the shot. One argument in favor of excluding this variable is the possibility that one is considering online marketing channels which usually have an inmediate impact, since including adstock implies that the impact spreads out during the following days, then it is reasonable that the results of adstocked investment are not statiscally significant."

    "Two important remarks:\n",
    "1. The way I'm proposing to answer this business questions has one very importante caveat, which is that I'm using there is no time dependence. That is, the money I invest today will have no impact whatsoever tomorrow. In this case, this makes sense since models with adstock do not yield good results, but this is something worth considering if there is evidence that suggests that what we today has an impact tomorrow in terms of possible conversions. If that were the case, a simple function as the one before becomes useless as it doesn't take into account that phenomena.\n",
    "2. The average CPC is only useful to get an overall grasp of how much each conversion consts. Nonetheless, it should be taken into account the diminishing returns nature of the relationship between investment and conversions. This means that, when taking an average CPC, that number is biased by the first conversions which are quite cheap, which is definitely not the case for conversions obtained at higher levels of investment. Another way of putting it is that, this number doesn't reflect the actual CPC of the last conversions. For example, if we have a daily goal of 5000 conversions, and the CPC is at 1000, what's happening is that the converion number 5000 is way above 1000. Therefore, we need another tool that addresses this issue, there we go next."
